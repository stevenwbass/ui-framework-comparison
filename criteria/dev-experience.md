# Dev Experience

Evaluate the developer experience of using the candidate framework or library. Efficiency, learning curve of the tooling, and ease-of-use should be considered.

### Considerations:

- Is hot reloading supported? 
- Is time-travel debugging of state supported? 
- What browser extensions are available to support development? 
- How valuable are console warnings and errors? 
- What is the debugging experience like using dev tools? 
- What code editors / IDEs are supported or recommended?
