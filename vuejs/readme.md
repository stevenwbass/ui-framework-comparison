**Description:** Vue.js is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.Integration into projects that use other JavaScript libraries is made easy with Vue because it is designed to be incrementally adoptable. Vue can also function as a web application framework capable of powering advanced single-page applications. The project focuses on making ideas in web UI development (components, declarative UI, hot-reloading, time-travel debugging, etc.) more approachable. It attempts to be less opinionated and thus easier for developers to pick up.It features an incrementally adoptable architecture. The core library focuses on declarative rendering and component composition, and can be embedded into existing pages. Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.

**History:** Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in a number of projects. He later summed up his thought process, "I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight without all the extra concepts involved?" Vue was originally released in February 2014.
